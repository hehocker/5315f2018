      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a computer program that performs containerization. According to Docker.com, a container is a standard unit of software that contains all the required code and associated software (dependencies). By using containers, programmers can make sure that software always runs the same way and delivers consistent results. Therefore, it is easy to share containers with co-workers or programming partners.
